# AOS-package-GUI

Avdan OS isn't just a desing its a workflow. A workflow I want to shape mainly because I like the idea and concept behind it. It's Linux and it's open source.

## Project Status
### Todo:
- Manpages are shown not properly
- install and remove etc doesnt work
- parser to make an easy package list possible
- noup files have to be made better in terms of usage
- add multiple mirrors to be able to use and merge the pkglists
### Done
